                        Like in any endeavor, having a strong foundation is key to discovering success and doing work you can be proud of. There are a lot of easy workarounds and patchwork that are really just excuses to our lack of understanding. The quality of code that we put together as developers will show not only during its production process but also years down the line when other developers are able to maintain it. Let's not find ourselves getting into the habit of just making things work and leaving everything else as a mess. This concept not only applies to programming or web development but can also manifest on a person's character and motivation. We all might have flaws and have made mistakes along the line but choosing only the best parts from our experiences will turn into something good eventually.
