          <h2>The International 2018</h2>
          <p>
            Since forming in 2015, OG has been a consistent presence at the top
            of competitive Dota 2. Facing a mountain of issues including most of
            the team leaving the organization right before The International
            2018, OG rebuilt from the ground up behind their captain, Johan
            “N0tail” Sundstein, and stunned the world by winning the Aegis of
            Champions. That win immortalized the team in Dota history, finally
            giving N0tail his elusive TI victory despite having to overcome so
            many obstacles to get there. It was such an incredible Cinderella
            story that one of the team’s sponsors, Red Bull decided to make a
            documentary about OG’s TI8 run. The documentary, called Against the
            Odds, released on
            <a href="https://youtu.be/bdgTa9ni4S8" target="blank">YouTube</a>.

          <h2>The International 2019</h2>
          <p>
            OG has finished the sequel to last year’s Cinderella story by taking
            another International crown and becoming the first team in Dota 2
            history to win the tournament twice. OG’s storyline undoubtedly
            dominated the TI headlines once again. Gathering the same roster of
            players to contest the Aegis, the defending champions weren’t the
            favorites heading into TI9 for several reasons, including Anathan
            “ana” Pham’s six-month holiday and their mediocre results throughout
            the season. But the moment they played their first game in Shanghai,
            all doubts were dispelled as captured by Valve's documentary
